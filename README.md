# DFS-Maze-Solver
DFS Maze Solving algorithm using Deep Q-Learning

The environment consists of a maze that is randomly generated using a depth-first search algorithm, and it is used to estimate Q-values. The agent can make four possible moves (up, down, left, and right) from the starting maze cell (S) with the goal of reaching the End of maze (E). The starting position is selected in a way that it first explores the region near the goal, gradually expanding its exploration to more distant areas of the maze as the training progresses.
